                    <p>Hello, I'm Joselito R. Yancha Jr., 20 years old and I live in Santa Maria, Bulacan. I'm currently studying at Polytechnic University of the Philippines Santa Maria Campus and I'm 2nd Year student taking the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology(BSIT). I'm taking this course because I want to learn more about technology, how it actually works, how the communication between computer works, and it is also interesting due to being changing or upgrading over the time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>I created this page to show off my skills in HTML and CSS, I'm only beginner at this and I need to learn more. This is also a project to one of our major subjects in the BSIT course so feel free to explore and judge this piece of work. Thank you!</p>
